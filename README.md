# Flight Navigator

Imagine you're an airline, tasked with routing people between various cities, while maintaining an ever-changing map of cities and flights between cities. I have managed to build a system to solve this problem. This system will keep track of a set of named cities as well as a set of bi-directional links between them. It'll be able to answer queries about the number of cities and the links each city has to others, and also find routes between cities.
